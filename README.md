# Network-Emulator
This repository contains the implementation and research-style report for the Network Emulator project, developed as part of the coursework. The project aims to simulate a computer network environment, including bridges, stations, and routers, using socket programming and software-based components.

Getting Started
To run the network emulator, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the Code directory.
Compile the source code files using the appropriate compiler for your chosen programming language.
Execute the compiled binaries for bridges, stations, and routers as per the provided instructions.
For detailed instructions and guidelines, refer to the README files within the Documentation directory.

Feel free to use, modify, and distribute the code for academic or non-commercial purposes.
